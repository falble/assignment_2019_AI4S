Final Project for the course Artificial Intelligence for Security regarding Network Traffic Analysis and Android Malware Detection

**Francesco Albertini**, **Filippo Lafronza**, **Guglielmo Ranieri**

## The Assignment:

- must be completed in groups:
  - each group should consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students.
- involves writing a Jupyter notebook to analyse the traffic data as described below.
  - notebooks should be self-explanatory, with “mark-down” containing description of what
analysis you are performing and discussion of the results.
- is due by midnight Thursday the 19th of December (via BEEP).
  - requires each group to present their notebook during the practical session on Friday 20th of
December at 2:15pm.

## The Datasets:

- The assignment makes use of 2 publicly available datasets.
- The first dataset contains network flow data with simulated attacks on a network.
  - It comes from: https://www.hs-coburg.de/forschung-kooperation/forschungsprojekteoeffentlich/
informationstechnologie/cidds-coburg-intrusion-detection-data-sets.html
  - The full dataset is quite large (each CSV file is over 1GB), so we have provided you with
10% samples of the data (see the folder description below).
  - If you’d like to download and use the entire dataset, you can, but beware that you will
need considerable memory, so first get things working on the sample we’ve provided!
    - (In the download, the folder we are using is: CIDDS-001/traffic/OpenStack)
- The second dataset contains features detailing the behaviour of android applications, some benign
and some malicious.
  - The data was downloaded from:
https://figshare.com/articles/Android_malware_dataset_for_machine_learning_2/5854653
  - The dataset is not particularly large, (although it does contain a large number of features
per example), so we have not made any changes to it.
